I was travelling through Raesfeld when I came across an abandoned factory.

Nearby, a dog was lounging in a Porsche parked by the beer garden.

This scene, albeit quite alarming, caught little attention from me as I noticed in front of me a delicious looking doener.

I could smell fresh brot coming from a nearby Baeckerei.

Around the corner was the Flughafen, hearing all the airplanes takeoff.
